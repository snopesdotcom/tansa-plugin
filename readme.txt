* a single proofing system for all your users, in all your writing tools, making sure your organization's spelling and style rules are consistently applied.
* an advanced text proofing system that can process thousands of words per second. Not only will it correct nearly all spelling, usage, style, punctuation and hyphenation errors in the blink of an eye, it also ensures that everyone in your organization follows the same set of rules.
* an open system, enabling it to work with most word processors, database managers, layout programs and content management systems (CMS) in use today. It is easy to use, requires almost no training, and can usually be installed without modifications to your current system set-up or workflow.
* perfectly adapted to a world where parallel publishing on several platforms is becoming the norm. It works equally well with print, web and electronic publishing, and can be customized for any technology.

THE DICTIONARY can be customized for every customer. As an option, we can analyze a large volume of your company's published text. This helps us compile a custom-made dictionary incorporating specialized terminology, proper names, language style, etc. The Tansa Administrator web application lets you add words and phrases, tweak proofing rules, and keep your dictionary up-to-date. Tansa also provides frequent updates to your dictionary, including new words, phrases and proper names.

PLUG-INS/EXTENSIONS
Tansa provides extensions for a range of applications and CMS systems, including browsers, Google Docs, Microsoft Office and Adobe InDesign/InCopy. If that does not cover your needs, Tansa has several APIs to seamlessly integrate Tansa into your editing environment.

== Installation ==

1. After installing and activating the Tansa plugin, your users can access Tansa this way:

	**For WordPress 5 and higher, with the Gutenberg editor:**
	* There will be a red Tansa button inside the WordPress Settings menu (click the three vertical dots in the top right corner). This will open the Tansa pane. For easier access going forward, the user can make Tansa a favorite plugin, by clicking the Star icon in the top of the Tansa pane. This will create a red Tansa button on the WordPress toolbar.
	
	**For WordPress 4, with the TinyMCE editor:**
	* There will be a red Tansa button in the toolbar above the text editing area.
	
2. Once the Tansa plugin is installed and activated, you will see the "Tansa Settings" menu in the main menu section, where you can preconfigure the Tansa "Server URL" and "License Key" for all your users.
   For more information on how set the Server URL and License Key, please see the screenshot section.

== How to use? ==
Clicking the Tansa button gives a menu with the proofing options available to that user. Clicking one of the proofing options will make Tansa scan the whole or selected text and provide the finds in a user interface to the user, so the user can decide what changes should be done to the text.
